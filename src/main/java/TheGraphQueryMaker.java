        /* For the last one, we are using "replace" instead of "replaceAll" cuz replaceAll needs "\\\\\"" as replacement, since
         * replaceAll takes regEx and don't know what the fuck is happening in there..... replace works best for replacing " with \".
         * On top of it, replaceAll has a big overhead. So try to avoid it.
         *
         * Thanks to some Random Internet person on link : https://coderanch.com/t/382457/java/String-replaceAll (We now know ðŸ‘‡)
         *
         * Remember that the second parameter of the replaceAll() method is not just a string. It is also a regex replacement string.
         * The easiest way to figure out the correct number of backslashes is to deal with the regex first, and then the java string second.
         *
         * What you want is........ \"
         *
         * First, in regex (replacement string), the backslash has special meaning, so you will need to escape that.
         *
         * Now you have........... \\"
         *
         * Second, in Java String, the backslash and the quote has special meaning, so you will need to escape all three.
         *
         * Giving you a final result of ......... \\\\\"
         *
         * Additionally, Refer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11769555/java-regular-expression-to-match-a-backslash-followed-by-a-quote#:~:text=To%20write%20a%20literal%20%5C%20in,Fun%2C%20eh%3F%20%E2%80%93
